  Welcome to the TeenTix. (&ldquo;TeenTix&rdquo;, &ldquo;We&rdquo;, &ldquo;Us&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our&rdquo;) Terms of Service (the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of our website located at www.teentix.org (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the TeenTix App and any other TeenTix mobile device applications (&ldquo;Apps&rdquo;). Please read the Terms carefully. If you have any questions, contact us at info@teentix.org. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, Our services and Apps are collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;.<br />
  <strong>Agreement to Terms</strong><br />
  By accessing, installing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, simply do not use the Services.<br />
  <strong>Changes to Terms or Services</strong><br />
  We may modify the Terms and our Services at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we&rsquo;ll let you know either on the Site, the Apps or through other means of communications. It&rsquo;s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because continuing to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or Apps indicates to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don&rsquo;t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then discontinue use of the Services immediately. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice to you, at our sole discretion.<br />
  <strong>Creating an Account</strong><br />
  In order to access and use the Services, you will need to sign in using your TeenTix login details or sign in with Facebook&reg;, if applicable. By creating an Account, you become a &ldquo;User&rdquo; and represent that you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.<br />
  Your Account should be yours &ndash; don&rsquo;t use the App under the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person, or use a username that is subject to rights of another person without appropriate authorization.<br />
  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false or misleading or to reclaim any username that you create through the Services that violates Our Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Account, and agree to notify Us if your password is lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. You are responsible for activities that occur under your Account.<br />
  You can link your Account to various social networks and other online platforms with which the Services are integrated. You may only link your own Account(s) and by doing so, you expressly authorize Us to retain your Account information from those third party accounts, on your behalf and permit Us to store your Account information for the purpose of providing the Services.<br />

  DMCA/Copyright Policy<br />
  TeenTix respects copyright law and expects its Users to do the same. It is Our policy to terminate in appropriate circumstances the Accounts of Users who repeatedly infringe the rights of copyright holders.</p>
<p>
  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that Content infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Us a notice requesting that the Content be removed or access to it blocked. Federal law requires that your notification include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit Us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail; (v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed</p>
<p>
  The notification must be sent to:</p>
<p>
  TeenTix<br />
  Attn: Legal Department<br />
  305 Harrison St.<br />
  Seattle, WA 98109</p>
<p>
  We provide the above contact information for purposes of the DMCA only and reserve the right to respond only to correspondence that is relevant to this purpose.<br />

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of TeenTix. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<br />
